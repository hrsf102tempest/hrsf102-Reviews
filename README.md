# Project Name

> Project description. Displaying Yelp reviews. Each review contains a profile of the reviewer with various descriptive elements ( profile photo, name, location, number of friends, number of reviews, number of photos) and the review itself ( stars, date, review, useful/funny/cool). When the user hovers the cursor over the reviewer profile, an additional interface appears with 5 addtional elements (Share Review, Embed Review, Compliment, Send Message, Follow [Reviewer name]).

As a stretch goal, I would like to include additional elements, such as check-ins, '--voted for this review', and photos and comments for individual reviews. Additionally, there is a 'Recommended Reviews' bar located at the top of the reviews list, including a search bar, and an interface that allows the user to initiate a review.
